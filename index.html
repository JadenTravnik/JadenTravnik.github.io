                    <p>When I was about 10, I was told that I had to pick my clothes off of my floor. It was around that time that I wanted to make a robot that could do it for me.</p>
                    <p>20 years later I have learned 2 important things: How to pick up my own clothes up off the floor and building a robot that can do it for me is both a multifaceted mechanical engineering problem as well as a very complex sequential decision task that cutting edge machine learning techniques still struggle to accomplish. Nevertheless, I have slowly found my way into the field of artificial intelligence where my dream of a robot that could do my chores for me is a problem domain instead of just a farfetched dream.</p>
                    <p>Besides artificial intelligence, I also spend my time finding good co-op boardgames, writing and playing video games, painting Cthulu in the background of second hand paintings and playing music.</p>

                    <p>After graduating from my MSc, I started working at <a href="https://www.eidosmontreal.com">Eidos Montreal</a>. It was a very rewarding experience working at at AAA games company. It was enlightening to work with such talented people and to focus on creative applications of machine learning within video games.</p>
                    <p>While at Eidos, I was leading a team focused on Automated Game Testing using Reinforcement Learning agents to help Quality Assurance teams validate game functionality. With researchers from <a href="https://www.matsuko.com/">Matsuko</a>, we came up with the Grid Sensor, a novel way of representing observation data to reinforcement learning agents without requiring rendering or large models. We open sourced the Grid Sensor to the Unity MLAgents repository along with a <a href="https://blogs.unity3d.com/2020/11/20/how-eidos-montreal-created-grid-sensors-to-improve-observations-for-training-agents/">Unity Blog.</a> describing the motivation.</p>
                    <p>After releasing the Grid Sensor, Eidos pivoted to using the Unreal Engine where I reimplemented the Grid Sensor and published the first <a href="https://www.eidossherbrooke.com/en/news/the-grid-sensor-for-automated-game-testing/">Eidos Sherbrooke</a> blog post on it.</p>

                    <p>While I was in Japan I wanted to play some games with friends back home. I found that the bigger the game, the more data that needed to be transfered and thus the slower the connection. 
                        To fix this, I implemented my own multiplayer platformer game called <a href="http://platformation.herokuapp.com/">Platformation</a> using node.js and hosted it on Heroku. 
                        The game itself is pretty fun and has given me a lot of experience making multiplayer games and using node.js and also allowed me to play with friends when the internet was a bit slow.

                    <p>I have had this idea for a game for like, 10 years now, and I thought "Hey, now that I am done my masters, I should really put some time into writing this game. The game I have in mind has many many variables and branches that direct the player through the game based on their interactions. Because of this, I found it very difficult to write and although there are editors out there like <a href='http://twinery.org/'>Twine</a> that offer good tools, they seemed like overkill for what I needed and at the same time didn't have the control that I wanted. So instead I built <a href='http://build-your-adventure.herokuapp.com/editor'>Build Your Adventure</a> which is very lightweight and can run on the browser.

                    <p>In early 2015 I participated in a Global Game Jam with some talented friends. We were given 48 hours and we created a <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2015/games/purrfect-pace">game</a> with original story, art and music. There were many things I learned in this project and I had a lot of fun doing it. I highly recommend participating in a Game Jam if you have the chance.</p>
